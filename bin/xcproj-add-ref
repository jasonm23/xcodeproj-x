  Usage: $(basename $0) "<project name>" <file> [files...]

  <project name> is used to locate the:
  - <project_name>.xcodeproj
  - file group <project_name>
  - build target <project_name>

  All files are added to the file group and target build phase
  The file group will also sorted after adding the new files.

  The expected location of the files is within the folder named <project_name>,
  which resides in the root directory recognized by XCode as the project's main
  folder. This folder will already contain existing source code.
